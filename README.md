## Getting started

For more documentation check out the cira **[wiki](https://github.com/AxelGard/cira/wiki)**.

Since the Alpaca trade API need a API key, you need to generate your own key at [alpaca markets website](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup). If you want to play around with it you can try paper trading (recommended for beginners). I recommend keep it in a **JSON file** which cira needs the **path** to.
You can also set the variables directly or use an environment variable, see the [wiki](https://github.com/AxelGard/cira/wiki/Storing-the-Alpaca-API-key) for diffrent the ways. However, it is recommended that you store it in a file just make sure not to upload that file on any public repositories. <br>
**key.json**
```json
{
  "APCA-API-KEY-ID":"your_pub_key",
  "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY":"your_private_key"
}
```

then you can start using the lib
```python
import cira
cira.alpaca.KEY_FILE = "../mypath/key.json"
stock = cira.Stock("TSLA")
stock.buy(1)
stock.sell(1)
```

New classes with cira v.2!
```python
portfolio = cira.Portfolio() # methods for your portfolio
exchange = cira.Exchange() # methods for exchange
stock = cira.Stock("TSLA") # a class for one stock
```
